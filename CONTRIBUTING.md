# Contributing to @plasius/voice

First off: thanks for taking the time to contribute!
This document explains how to work on the project, how to propose changes, and what we expect in pull requests.

> TL;DR
>
> - Be respectful and follow the Code of Conduct.
> - Open an issue before large changes; small fixes can go straight to a PR.
> - Write tests, keep coverage steady or improving.
> - Use Conventional Commits.
> - Donâ€™t include real PII in code, issues, tests, or logs.

## Licensing & CLA

This project is open source (see `LICENSE`). To protect contributors and users, we require contributors to agree to our **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** before we can merge PRs (see `legal/CLA.md`). Youâ€™ll be prompted automatically by the CLA bot on your first PR.

## What this project does

`@plasius/voice` provides a small, strongly-typed schema library:

- A fluent field builder (e.g. `field().string().required()`),
- Built-in validators for common standards (ISO/RFC/OWASP, etc.),
- PII annotations + redaction utilities,
- Type inference for safe, consistent entities across projects.

Contributions typically fall into: new validators, field builder features, type improvements, docs, and tooling quality.

---

## Getting started (local dev)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (use the version specified in `.nvmrc` if present: `nvm use`).
- npm (we use npm scripts in this repo).

### Install

```bash
npm ci
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Test

```bash
npm test
# or, if using Vitest in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Lint & format

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

> Tip: set up your editor to run ESLint and Prettier on save.

## How to propose a change

### 1) For bugs

- Search existing issues first.
- Open a new issue with:
  - Clear title, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behaviour,
  - Minimal repro (code snippet or small repo),
  - Environment info (OS, Node, package version).

### 2) For features / refactors

- For anything non-trivial, open an issue first and outline the proposal.
- If the change affects public API or architecture, add an ADR draft (see `docs/adrs/`).

### 3) Good first issues

We label approachable tasks as **good first issue** and **help wanted**.

---

## Branch, commit, PR

### Branching

- Fork or create a feature branch from `main`: `feat/xyz` or `fix/abc`.

### **Commit messages** (Conventional Commits)

- `feat: add ISO-3166 alpha-3 validator`
- `fix: correct RFC5322 email regex edge-case`
- `docs: expand PII redaction examples`
- `refactor: simplify field builder pipeline`
- `test: add cases for currency code`
- `chore: bump dev deps`

### **Pull Requests**

- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Include tests for new/changed behaviour.
- Update docs (README, JSDoc, ADRs) as needed.
- Add a clear description of what & why, with before/after examples if useful.
- Ensure CI is green (lint, build, tests).

### **PR checklist**

- [ ] Title uses Conventional Commits
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Lint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Build passes (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Docs updated (README/ADR/CHANGELOG if needed)
- [ ] No real PII in code, tests, or logs

## Coding standards

- **Language:** TypeScript with `strict` types.
- **Style:** ESLint + Prettier.
- **Tests:** Prefer Vitest (or Jest) + `@testing-library/*` for React-facing bits.
- **Public API:** Aim for backward compatibility; use SemVer and mark breaking changes clearly (`feat!:` or `fix!:`).
- **Performance:** Avoid excessive allocations in hot paths; prefer immutable patterns but mind GC pressure.
- **Docs:** Add TSDoc comments for exported types/functions.

### Validators

- Add tests covering common/edge cases.
- Cite the source/standard (e.g., ISO/RFC) in comments.
- Keep regexes readable (use `x`/comments where possible) and benchmark if complex.

### PII handling

- Never include real PII in fixtures or examples.
- Ensure redaction/cleaning functions operate **before** logging.
- Add tests confirming no PII leaks to logs or thrown errors.

---

## Adding dependencies

- Minimise runtime dependencies; prefer dev dependencies.
- Justify any new runtime dependency in the PR description (size, security, maintenance).
- Avoid transitive heavy deps unless critical.

---

## Versioning & releases

- We follow **SemVer**.
- Breaking changes require a major bump and migration notes.
- Keep the `CHANGELOG.md` (or release notes) clear about user-facing changes.

---

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` with new features or setup steps.
- Add or update ADRs in `docs/adrs/` for architectural decisions.
- Keep examples minimal, copy-pasteable, and tested when feasible.

---

## Maintainersâ€™ process (overview)

- Triage new issues weekly; label and assign.
- Review PRs for correctness, tests, and docs.
- Squash-merge with Conventional Commit titles.
- Publish from CI when applicable.

---

## Questions

If you have questions or want feedback before building:

- Open a discussion or issue with a short proposal,
- Or draft a PR early (mark as **Draft**) to get directional feedback.
