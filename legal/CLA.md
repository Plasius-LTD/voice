# Contributor License Agreements (CLA)

To protect the intellectual property of this project and ensure clarity of rights, all contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their first contribution.

## Which CLA should I sign?

- **Individual CLA**: If you are contributing personally and not on behalf of an employer, sign the [Individual CLA](INDIVIDUAL_CLA.md).
- **Corporate CLA**: If you are contributing as part of your work for a company, the company should sign the [Corporate CLA](CORPORATE_CLA.md).

## How to sign

1. Download the appropriate CLA file (Individual or Corporate).
2. Fill in the required details, sign, and date it.
3. Email a PDF copy of the signed document to **[contributors@plasius.co.uk](mailto:contributors@plasius.co.uk)** with subject: `CLA – Individual` or `CLA – Corporate`.

## Registry

All signed CLAs are logged internally in the CLA registry (`CLA-REGISTRY.csv`).

## Questions?

If you have any questions about which CLA to sign or how the process works, please email **[contributors@plasius.co.uk](mailtocontributors@plasius.co.uk)**.
